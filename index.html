      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>This course provides a foundation in the principles, architectures, and applications of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI).
          It explores how large language models (LLMs) work by guiding students through the complete model lifecycle: from core building blocks like
          embedding representations, attention mechanisms, and transformer architectures to adaptation techniques including in-context learning,
          prompt tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).</p>

        <p>The course also explores advanced topics such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agentic reasoning systems, and multimodal learning
          that extends beyond text to incorporate vision and other data modalities.</p>

        <p>Programming assignments, paper readings, and a team-based final project will help students develop the technical proficiency to design,
          implement, and evaluate GenAI pipelines using Hugging Face, LangChain, and other open-source LLM APIs, while critically assessing their capabilities,
          limitations, and responsible use in real-world applications.</p>

        <p>All materials for this course will be posted on this page.</p>

    <b>Assignments</b>
    <p>
      Students will complete two individual assignments (each worth 15% of the final grade) designed to connect
      lecture concepts with data-driven, real-world applications. Late submissions are accepted up to three days past the deadline, with a <b>10% absolute deduction per day</b>.
Assignments will be posted on this website and
      submitted through Gradescope.
    </p>

    <b>Final Project</b>
    <p>
      The final project is designed to help you develop practical skills in building generative AI pipelines for
      real-world applications. You will work in teams of <b>3–4 students</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Project grades will be determined based on the proposal, milestone, final report, and poster presentation,
      with adjustments made for group size and individual contributions. The final project accounts for <b>50%</b>
      of the total course grade, distributed as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>5%</b>: Project proposal</li>
      <li><b>15%</b>: Project milestone</li>
      <li><b>20%</b>: Final report</li>
      <li><b>10%</b>: Poster presentation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      There is <b>no late policy</b> for the final project. All deliverables must be submitted on time.
      Detailed project guidelines will be distributed at the beginning of the semester.
    </p>

    <b>Paper Reading</b>
    <p>
      Each team will select one recent generative AI paper (e.g., ACL, NeurIPS, or arXiv) to summarize and
      discuss in class. Grading will be based on clarity and the ability to connect theory to practice.
    </p>

    <b>Participation</b>
    <p>
      Active engagement during class is essential for mastering GenAI concepts. Participation will be evaluated
      based on contributions to discussions, questions asked, and involvement in group exercises.
      Participation accounts for <b>1% per week</b> of the total course grade.

  <div class="panel-heading">Use of AI Chatbots</div>
  <div class="panel-body">

    <p>
      Students may use AI chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others) to clarify concepts, debug code,
      generate small code snippets for study or practice, or paraphrase/revise text that they originally authored.
      Chatbot use must align with the principles of academic integrity and may not replace a student’s independent effort.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Students may not submit large blocks of unmodified chatbot-generated code or use chatbots to complete entire problems.</li>
      <li>Students must be able to explain all submitted code and may be asked to demonstrate understanding in follow-up assessments.</li>
      <li>
        When chatbots are used, students must include a comment in their code specifying the tool and the exact prompt used
        (e.g., “I used ChatGPT for this problem with the prompt: ‘How to implement a bubble sort in Python?’”).
      </li>
      <li>
        If chatbots are used to paraphrase or revise text originally written by the student, the student must explicitly
        disclose how the tool was used.
      </li>
      <li>Misuse of chatbots or failure to follow this policy will result in disciplinary action as outlined in the course syllabus.</li>

      All students are expected to follow the UC Berkeley Code of Student Conduct. While the final project is a
      collaborative effort, all assignments must be completed independently unless explicitly stated otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
      All written work must be your own. If you reference the work of others, you must clearly cite the appropriate source.
      This applies to source code as well—if you use code from external sources (e.g., Stack Overflow, ChatGPT), you must cite its origin.
    </p>
